# Pre-requisites

**If you feel comfortable with React, Redux, and Immutable.js you can skip this.**


Shasta itself is simple, but it's built on the shoulders of other great projects. Before diving in, we recommend reading the following:

## React

- [Why React?](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/why-react.html)
- [Thinking in React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
- [Displaying Data](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/displaying-data.html)
- [Interactivity](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/interactivity-and-dynamic-uis.html)
- [Multiple Components](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/multiple-components.html)
- [Reusable Components](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html)
- [Component Lifecycle](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-specs.html)

## Redux

*PS: Don't pay too much attention to the code examples, Shasta simplifies things so the code is quite different.*
